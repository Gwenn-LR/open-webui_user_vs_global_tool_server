# Description

This repository is only a reference to demonstrate an issue with `Open WebUI` while setting up Global Tool Servers. It appears that while User Tool Servers and Global Tool Servers are supposed to function the same way once the latter does not show information about the answer, while the former does.

# Setup

> ```bash
> docker volume create open-webui
> docker compose up
> docker exec -ti open-webui_user_vs_global_tool_server-ollama-1 ollama pull mistral:7b
> ```

# Reproduce

One the stack is created and setup, other configurations will be done in the `Open WebUI` interface :
- Setup the admin account.
- Create the Global Tool Server.

- Add it to the Model associated to `mistral:7b`
![alt text](<assets/Setup model.png>)
- Toggle it in the current chat.
![alt text](<assets/Toogle tool.png>)
- Prompt somethink like "With the generate_code tool, return the generated code without any other information.".
![alt text](<assets/Global Tool Servers answer.png>)
- Create a new chat (Global Tool Server is deactivated y default)
- Create a User Tool Server
![alt text](<assets/User Tool Servers.png>)
- Prompt the same text.

We can see that there is a bubble with information, that was not there with Global Tool Server.
